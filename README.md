# Project Title

wabisabi

## Overview

<!-- What is your app? Give a brief description in a couple of sentences. -->

Wabisabi is a task-management tool for diagnosed and undiagnosed neurodivergent individuals to keep track of and accomplish tasks in a way that uniquely motivates themself. The goal is to enable users to thrive in their individuality while existing in a neurotypical space.

### Problem Space

<!-- Why is your app needed? Give any background information around any pain points or other reasons. -->

Neurodivergents are motivated by interest and/or urgency. When a task doesn't personally appeal to a neurodivergent individual it can be extremely difficult for them to accomplish said task even if it's a simple task by neurotypical standards. 

Wabisabi is a Japanese word that describes a world view focused on celebrating the beauty of imperfection and the acceptance of impermanence. Wabisabi resonates deeply with the neurodivergent experience, to embrace neurodivergent traits that are traditionally seen as flaws such as executive dysfunction, sensory sensitivities and inattentiveness. 

The connection between wabisabi and neurodivergence cultivates a mindset that values authenticity, self-compassion and the richness of diverse experiences. Rather than considering neurodivergence as something to fix, the focus is shifted to appreciate the inherent beauty of everyone's unique existence.

### User Profile

For neurodivergent individuals:

- looking to organize and game-ify their life
- looking to create rewards that are personally fulfilling to spark interest in accomplishing tasks 
- looking to implement controls that help them keep track of their priorities
